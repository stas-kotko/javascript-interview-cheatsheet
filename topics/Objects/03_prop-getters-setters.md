# Property getters and setters

There are two kinds of object properties:
- _data props_ - regular ones
- _accesor props_ - getters/setters

They are essentially _functions_ that execute on getting and setting a value, but look like regular properties to an external code.

```js
let obj = {
  get propName() {
    // getter, the code executed on getting obj.propName
  },

  set propName(value) {
    // setter, the code executed on setting obj.propName = value
  }
};
```

### Accessor descriptors

Descriptors for accessor properties are different from those for data properties.

For accessor properties, there is no `value` or `writable`, but instead there are `get` and `set` functions.

That is, an accessor descriptor may have:

- `get` – a function without arguments, that works when a property is read,
- `set` – a function with one argument, that is called when the property is set,
- `enumerable` – same as for data properties,
- `configurable` – same as for data properties.
