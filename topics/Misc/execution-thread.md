# Execution thread

JS is a single threaded language

Single sequentional flow of control

Synchronous language with async capabilities

A thread has a _call stack_ (execution context stack) and a _memory heap_.

The call stack:
- stack of functions to be executed
- manages execution context
- LIFO
- Global execution context is always at the bottom
