# The Four Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language and can be written following different programming paradigms. A programming paradigm is essentially a bunch of rules that you follow when writing code, to help you solve a particular problem.

That's what the four pillars are. They're software design principles to help you write clean Object-Orientated code.

The four pillars of object-oriented programming are:

- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism


## Abstraction


## Encapsulation

Removing access to parts of your code and making things private is exactly what Encapsulation is all about (often times, people refer to it as data hiding).

Private properties are achieved in JavaScript by using closures.


## Inheritance

Inheritance lets one object acquire the properties and methods of another object. In JavaScript this is done by **Prototypal Inheritance**.

Whenever we use inheritance, we try to make it so that the parent and the child have **high cohesion. Cohesion** is how related your code is.

When using inheritance, you should require most of the functionality (you don't always need absolutely everything).

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism means "the condition of occurring in several different forms."
